# Contributing
So you want to contribute to this repository?

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Coding Standards
Try to make it clean and easy to read with comments as necessary. A README.md is required for every problem solution. Please follow the standards put forth in the Templates folder.

Not all solution code will be clean. But make it as clean as possible within reason. The exact level of clean is up to the reviewers.

## Getting Your Code Picked
So let's say you have a solution you would like to submit to this repository.
**These are the steps to take to getting your solution into this repository.**  

1. Before anything else, prepare your code for submission.
  1. Double check that it passes **all** test cases.
  2. Remove any unused code.
  3. Comment anything that you did that is "weird" or "tricky". (not intuitive to the average reader)
2. Create a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) for your solution.
  - Example: [New Year Chaos](https://gist.github.com/asclines/b68eca735d392123d0cde2b343100677)
3. Once a Call for Submission issue is raised on that problem, you can submit your Gist by commenting a link to that Gist in the issue.
  - Example: [New Year Chaos Call for Submission](https://github.com/CodeSpaceHQ/AppliedAlgorithms/issues/38)
4. The maintainers will now determine which solutions (there may be 0, then may be multiple) that they believe belong in this repository. If yours is picked, an issue will be created and you will be notified.
  - Example: [New Year Chaos Problem](https://github.com/CodeSpaceHQ/AppliedAlgorithms/issues/4)
5. If you haven't already, [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository.
6. Create a folder for your solution in the appropriate spot (feel free to ask us if you are unsure where) and format the files in your folder appropriately. There should be 2 files (`README.md` and `solution.[EXTENSION]`)
  - Example: [New Year Chaos Folder](https://github.com/CodeSpaceHQ/AppliedAlgorithms/tree/master/Guide/Constructive/New%20Year%20Chaos)
7. Once you have written up your solution, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) into `master`.
8. Once the PR has been created, the maintainers will go over your solution giving their thoughts & suggestions. **Do not expect that your solution and guide will be perfect on the first try.** Don't worry, the maintainers are mostly nice :)

9. Once everything is polished up and the maintainers have given their last thoughts, one of them will merge your pull request and it will be done! Your solution and guide will finally be a part of this repository.


## Pull Request Process

1. Update the appropriate documentation.
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
