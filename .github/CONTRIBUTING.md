# Contributing
So you want to contribute to this repository?

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Coding Standards
Try to make it clean and easy to read with comments as necessary. A README.md is required for every problem solution. Please follow the standards put forth in the Templates folder.

Not all solution code will be clean. But make it as clean as possible within reason. The exact level of clean is up to the reviewers.

## Getting Your Code Picked
So let's say you have a solution you would like to submit to this repo. Before going through the pull request process, you will first need to submit your solution to be picked by the maintainers of this repo. Solutions will be submitted by [Gists](https://gist.github.com/). What will happen is that after a problem is released using the Issues of this repo, you can submit a link to your gist as a comment in that issue. If the maintainers like your solution, you will be contacted and asked to write up a solution guide to accompany your problem. A Pull Request will then be created so that the maintainers of this repo can give any final thoughts and suggestions before bring your solution into this repo.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the appropriate documentation.
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
