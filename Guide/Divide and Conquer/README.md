# Divide and Conquer Algorithms Guide

## [Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm)
Divide and Conquer Algorithms break given input into parts, solve each part recursively, and then combines the solution of these sub-problems into an
overall solution.


## Additional Resources

This divide and conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for all kinds of problems, such as sorting (e.g., quicksort, merge sort), multiplying large numbers (e.g. the Karatsuba algorithm), finding the closest pair of points, syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), and computing the discrete Fourier transform (FFTs).
