Difficulty to Understand:

## Problem
Given a personâ€™s preferences (for books, movies, etc.)
match them with preferences of other people on the Web with
similar interests to provide a suggestion.

Preferences are often defined by rankings, labeling the objects
from 1 to n. So the problem is to define the distance between
the rankings.
