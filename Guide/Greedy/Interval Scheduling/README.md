## Problem
### Overview
There is one resource which can be used by at most one person at a time. Multiple people request the use of this resource with a start time _s_ and a finish time _f_. Maximize the number of accepted requests so that no request (s, f) overlap, and the set of accepted requests are optimal, i.e. there is no other compatible set of requests with more requests.

_From Wikipedia:_
> Interval schedluing is a class of problems in computer science, particularly in the area of algorithm design. THe problems consider a set of tasks. Each task is represented by an _interval_ describing the time in which it needs to be executed. For instance, task A might run from 2:00 to 5:00, task B might run from 4:00 to 10:00, and task C might run from 9:00 to 11:00. A subset of intervals is _compatible_ if no two intervals overlap. For example, the subset {A, C} is compatible, as is the subset {B}; but neither {A, B} or {B, C} are compatible subsets, because the intervals within each subset overlap.

### Input Format
- A set _S_ containing n rquests in the form of _(s, f)_ where _s_ is the start time and _f_ is the finish time of a request.

### Constraints
- No two intervals _(s, f)_ may overlap within a solution, and the solution must be the most optimal soltuion of _S_, i.e. maximum number of requests in the solution.

### Output Format
- a list of the intervals existing in the optimal solution.

## Algorithm
### Overview
For our interval scheduling algorithm we will re-state the problem in a more precise way:

> Given a set _R_ = {i<sub>1</sub>...,i<sub>n</sub>} of requests where each request _i_ is associated witha n interval [s(i), f(i)), find a best schedule, i.e. a subset _A_ of requests from _R_ such that: 

> 1. _A_ is _compatible_, i.e. _A_ contains no overlapping requests and 

> 2. _A_ is _optimal_, i.e. there is no compativle subset of _R_ which has more requests than _A_.


### Pseudo Code

## Version 1

```python

    def interval_scheduling(set_of_intervals):
      1. While set_of_intervals is not empty
        a. select a request _i_ from set_of_intervals with earliest finish time
        b. add _i_ it to the solution set
        c. remove all all sets incompatible with _i_ from set_of_intervals including _i_
      2. return the solution set
```

## Version 2

```python

    1. Sort set_of_intervals in order of finishing time.
    2. i = 0, n = len(set_of_intervals)
    3. f := âˆ’ 1
    4. while i <= n:
        a. if set_of_intervals[i]'s finish time is greater than or equal to f:
            1. append the interval to the solution set
            2. f = the intervals finish time
        b. i = i + 1
    5. return the solution set

```

### Analysis

## Version 1

Version 1 of the solution has a worst case time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) and a best case of O(n). Since the list of requests is not sorted
the algorithm must loop over the list of requests n times for the outer while loop, and n more times for finding the minimal finish time.

## Version 2

Version 2 of the solution has a worst case time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) and an average time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting of the set of request before finding the optimal solution.
The time complexity of the algorithm when the entire set of request is sorted by finish time is simply n, and the time complexity of sorting
the un-sorted set of requests is O(n log n), which means T(n) = O(n log n) + O(n) wherein the extra addition of n can be dropped.

## Conclusion
[Any final thoughts here, maybe discuss other ways to solve the problem that would be equally efficient]
