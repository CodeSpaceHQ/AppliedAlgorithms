# Greedy Algorithms Guide

## [Overview](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/greedy_algorithms.htm)
By maximizing or minimzing a metric, it's possible to solve many problems. Finding the right metric and writing an algorithm to optimize based off of it is the essence of good greedy algorithms.

## Additional Resources
More code or math focused examples can both be helpful, as it sometimes requires multiple perspectives to understand a new topic. Both are listed below.

### Extended Examples
A [more mathematical explanation](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap5.pdf) can be found from Berkeley. It also contains several extended examples of how to apply greedy algorithms.
