# Constructive Algorithms Guide

## [Overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof)
Constructive Algorithms aim to show that a solution exists to a problem by providing a method that creates the desired output.

## Additional Resources

Constructive Algorithms are useful when proving that something can be done, It typically requires the combination of applying mathematical principles or proofs by way of proper use of data structures and other algorithmic principles.  Below are some additional resources and examples.
